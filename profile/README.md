At **Night**, we are currently developing a state-of-the-art surveillance system that uses advanced AI technology to monitor city streets and public spaces. Our goal is to provide a constant watchful eye over your community, helping to **improve safety and security**. Our system is designed to be user-friendly and easy to implement, so you can trust that your city will be protected.

We are excited to announce that we will be launching in **3 cities** starting in Q4 2023. Our team is dedicated to providing exceptional support and guidance throughout the enrollment process, ensuring a seamless and successful implementation of our technology.

If you are interested in bringing **Night** to your city, please contact us at **[gov@getnight.co](mailto:gov@getnight.co)** to learn more about our technology and how it can benefit your community. We look forward to speaking with you and answering any questions you may have. Join the ranks of cities across the country who have already expressed interest in our program and trust in the potential of technology to improve city safety and security.
